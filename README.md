# Deep Learning for Next Basket Recommendation

This repository contains my implementations of [DREAM](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/english/irds/People/sw/DREAM.pdf) for
next basket prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.6.0
- Pandas 1.1.2
- Sklearn 0.19.1
- Numpy 1.16.2
- Gensim 3.5.0
- Tqdm 4.49.0

## Data

You can download
the [Negative Sample (neg_sample.pickle)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19SnHlic2DswgyPwr9ul3t9uDsgEsaH1X) used in
code. **Make sure they are under the `/data` folder.**

### Data Format

See data format in `data` folder which including the data sample files.

This repository can be used in other e-commerce datasets in two ways:

1. Modify your datasets into the same format of the sample.
2. Modify the data preprocess code in `data_helpers.py`.

Anyway, it should depend on what your data and task are.

## Network Structure

DREAM uses RNN to capture sequential information of users' shopping behavior. It extracts users' dynamic representations
and scores user-item pair by calculating inner products between users' dynamic representations and items' embedding.

The framework of DREAM:

1. Pooling operation on the items in a basket to get the representation of the basket.
2. The input layer comprises a series of basket representations of a user.
3. The dynamic representation of the user can be obtained in the hidden layer.
4. The output layer shows scores of this user towards all items.

## Notes from me

`train.py` is not runnable from terminal without tedious setting `PATH`, better to run in PyCharm which takes care of
hassles.
